                        <h3>Why get a website?</h3>
                        <p>The Internet has become a global market offering a lot of opportunities for people and businesses to make money. One way is by featuring what you sell on your very own website. A stylish, fully functional website spotting the latest
                            trends in user experience, design and interaction is not only a good investment but a necessary weapon in the arsenal of anyone fully aware of their place in a cut-throat competitive market. Our goal is to design and develop
                            such a website for you.</p>

                        <p>It's simple: we offer a better price to quality ratio compared to others. Lower prices and higher quality for everything we design is not just a strategy to get more clients but it is something at the core of our <a href="/about/#core-belief">beliefs</a>.
                            A larger part of our target market is composed of individuals just starting out and small businesses, and we believe that such clients deserve high quality products at a price they can afford. This way we increase our chances
                            of retaining clients and getting more deals.</p>

                        <h3>What's all the fuss about logos anyway?</h3>
                        <p>A logo is not just something that adds visual interest to a T-shirt or letterhead. If well-designed a logo can give you or your business a unique identity, one that will set it apart from the rest and give you, your business or
                            brand much needed recognition.</p>
                        <p>People get drawn to beautiful things, things that are in complete harmony with their sorroundings. The same principle applies to logos. A logo that is nice to look at, sits well wherever it is and gives relevance to whatever it
                            represents is one that endures the test of time and carries your identity a long way into the future.</p>

                        <h3>Do I need a Picasso for this?</h3>
                        <p>Logos don't have to be complex works of art. They can be as simple as a short word consisting of multi-coloured letters and sounding like what a toddler would say, something like, "Goo Goo."</p>
                        <p>If you haven't figured out by now that I'm reffering to the world-famous Google logo then you must have been hiding under some rock for the past twenty years. The Google logo, albeit simplistic in appearance, is part and parcel
                            of the company, it's many products and pretty much everything else the company does. And they've been doing some really amazing things, like giving us a mobile operating system called Android...free of charge! Ok, now I'm trolling.
                            Sorry.
                        </p>
                        <p>I'm not saying that a good logo alone will turn your company into a multi-billion dollar corporation. All I'm saying is that it can help it get there.</p>

                        <h3>Business Cards and Your Business</h3>
                        <p>From the outset a business card should provide some value to you and your business. Just how valuable it is depends largely on how well it's designed.</p>
                        <p>A well designed business card encourages potential clients to contact you and always remains within easy reach, safely tucked away in a wallet, for example. Poorly designed business cards hardly ever get a second glance and, worse,
                            give you and your business a poor impression, exactly like the card itself. And, believe me, there are a lot of poorly designed business cards out there. Perhaps you've seen one yourself, - or are even in posession of one.
                            A common trait among the many examples of poorly designed business cards out there is the cramming of a lot of usually useless information in so small a space. It's like trying to fit an entire company profile on a three-and-a-half
                            by two-inch piece of paper. And let us not even get started about the choice of colours.</p>
                        <p>A lot of people spend a lot of money trying to improve the impression they and their businesses give. A <em>less costly</em> way of doing that is by getting yourself a properly designed business card, one that will project a positive
                            outlook about you and your business and, in turn, help you get clients.</p>

                        <h3>Just how "less" is a less costly way?</h3>
                        <p>We pride ourselves in providing quality products at an affordable price, usually less than the current rates out there. This, to most of you, might not be the best way of doing any kind of business. To us, on the other hand, it's
                            the only way we believe in. Much of what we do is done out of a deeply rooted passion for design, the need to see the products of one's creative pursuits being used and enjoyed by everyone and, to top that off, the great feeling
                            of satisfaction we get from improving people's lives by doing what we do, no matter how small that improvement is.</p>
                        <p>We offer printing, packaging and posting services at an extra fee.</p>
                        <p>So, why not click on the "Check prices" button? Take advantage of our rates and let us design for you a business card that will do what it's supposed to do: get you business.</p>

                        <p>No one can doubt the relevance and effectiveness that brochures, flyers, posters or any other form of print advertisement still have in this day and age. Our eyes get drawn to colourful posters advertising all kinds of events.
                            We enjoy the fancy look and smooth feel of well designed brochures advertising available courses in schools. We appreciate just how well and how quick properly designed flyers tell us about an upcoming event, a newly opened
                            store that sells things at "unbeatable" prices or someone offering a reward for finding a lost item. The list of applications is endless!</p>
                        <p>There's one thing that is common to all these forms of advertisement: paper. Most people appreciate the feel of paper in their hands, reading words written or printed on paper, analyzing drawings and all kinds of illustrations
                            drawn or printed on paper, and the fact that they can fold that paper, put it in a pocket, pass on to a friend, do some origami magic with it, crumple up and hit a friend with it, toss in a trash can...paper...paper...paper.</p>

                        <p>Did I mention just how cheap this is? It costs so much less to advertise things this way than it is using radio or television. Of course this would not work if you wanted to let the whole country know just how tasty and affordable
                            your cakes are. You would need, ahem!, the aforementioned radio and television for that. But if your target audience is composed of people who live or work in a certain part of town then this way is the best way. </p>

                        <p>This, good sir, is neither man nor beast but sorcery of the highest order, practised only by those brave and powerful enough to venture into the deep dark vastness of the World Wide Web.</p>
                        <p>On second thought you can disregard that opening paragraph. Hope I didn't scare you there. Well, to put it simply, web scraping is the <em>art</em> and practice of extracting data from sources on the Internet and making it available
                            in whichever form you need it in, usually for a specific purpose. Let's say you've visited a page on the Internet listing the stock prices of hundreds or even thousands of companies over a given financial period and you need
                            all that data to use in preparing a financial report, for example, and you find that there's no way to download or copy this data using the normal means. What do you do next? Move on to another page hoping to see a download
                            button? This is where web scraping comes in. Or maybe you need a specific set of images in a large publicly available picture gallery but you don't know how to download them all at once. This, again, is where web scraping comes
                            to the rescue.

                        <h3>Let me break it down for you</h3>
                        <p>SEO stands for Search Engine Optimization. Search Engines are tools like Google Search or Microsoft Bing that return a <em>list of links</em> to <em>pages with content</em> that <em>best match</em> a user's search query. Take note
                            of the italicized phrases. In order for a search engine such as Google and Bing to rank you highly in their search results you need to <em>optimize</em> your website for proper indexing. Optimizing your site's pages and their
                            content to better influence higher ranking in search results is the way to go if you want to point users (potential consumers of your products and services) to your website.</p>
                        <p>Content Marketing, on the other hand, is a bit of a confusing subject to some. Typically it involves creating content - blogs, articles, free to download multimedia, basically useful information - that you make available free of
                            charge to your site's visitors. Now here's the confusing part: at no point in your blog or article should you advertise your products or services. The main idea behind content marketing is to create useful, original information
                            that search engines can happily index and include in higher ranking results, and that your site's visitors can benefit from and, in turn, share links to the content in online forums and social networking sites. So, in essence,
                            you've let search engines and your site's visitors market your products and services for you without you doing it outright. That, folks, is content marketing.</p>

                        <h3>Why bother?</h3>
                        <p>Search engines are smart enough these days to notice duplicate content. If you create content that has been featured elsewhere on the Internet there are high chances that Google bots (the programs that crawl pages on the Internet
                            looking for content to index, also called <em>spiders</em>) will crawl your pages, find nothing new and move on. Your site's visitors too will go over your content, notice that they've read the same exact thing elsewhere, and
                            move on, probably never to return. And that, obviously, is bad for business.</p>
                        <p>If you have a website that you need to optimize for search engines or want to try your hand on content marketing but don't know where to begin, we are here for you.</p>
