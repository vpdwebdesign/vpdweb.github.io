I'm the Manager at St Thomas Church Ufanisi Training Institute in Kilifi, North Coast. I met Victor through a friend while I was looking for someone to build a website for our college. He quickly mocked up a series of designs in Photoshop over several meetings we had in the following days. I liked the designs and he went on to build the website, integrating it into Wordpress so that we could be doing updates ourselves. He made the whole process seem so much simpler and quicker than I had thought initially.
