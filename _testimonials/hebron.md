I approached Victor with an offer to write me a web scraper that could collect specific job vacancy advertisements from several online sites here in the country and give me the results in a neat way that I could quickly digest. He said yes and wrote me a program in _Python_, installed it on my laptop and it did more than what I expected. I could filter results by salary, location, or whatever criteria was available. This was an invaluable tool. I have a job now but my friends use it from time to time. Sometimes I fire it up just for fun to see the results the program comes up with. I'll definitely hook up with them for future projects.
