I'm the Pastor at a small church in Shimoni, South Coast. VPDWEB have been very helpful in helping me design a series of advertisement material for church functions. The great thing about our relationship is that we rarely have to meet face to face. I simply call them up, tell them what I need, and a few email attachments later we settle on a final design which they quickly print, package and send over by post. It's that simple. Their rates are also affordable compared to the people I've dealt with in the past.
