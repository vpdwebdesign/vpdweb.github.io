Well, I was referred to VPDWEB by a friend who had good things to say about their services. But I just wanted a simple logo done. I called them up, we met, talked about a side project and a few days later I had myself a beautiful, simple logo which looked good in colour as it did in black and white. Since then these are my go to guys for most of my design stuff.
