Well, I was referred to VPDWEB by a friend. I just wanted a simple logo done. I called them up, we met, talked about this side project I had at the time and a few days later I had myself a beautiful, simple logo which looked good in colour as it did in black and white. Since then these are my go to guys for most of my design stuff, including my e-commerce website.
